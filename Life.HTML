<h2>Life란 무엇인가</h2>
<p><a href="https://search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&sm=top_hty&fbm=0&ie=utf8&query=south+korea"target="_blank" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>'s relations with Japan, its closest neighbor geographically with the exception of North Korea, have been put to the test under the Moon Jae-in administration after sinking to an unprecedented low.</p>
<p>Two leading presidential candidates, Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and Yoon Suk-yeol of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP), have presented starkly contrasting views of the causes of soured relations and how the two countries can mend the frayed ties.</p>
<p>The two sides also revealed significant differences in their diagnosis of the current South Korea-Japan relations.
Life is not an easy thing. It's <strong>very <u>complicated</u> one</strong> What we should do is prepare for everything.</p>
